# Browser
A lightweight personal browser application. Users can add shortcut keys to add the home page, mainly to add local notifications to remind users that they do not miss important information. It uses web redirection in it, which is equivalent to a fuzzy search. Some people say why I can't open goole home page with www.google.com requests, and my demo solves this problem. Because it took only a small amount of time to write the application, the code is a bit messy. If you have a good suggestion, you can send it to me, and you can send me mail.
